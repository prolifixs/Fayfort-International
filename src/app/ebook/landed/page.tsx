            <p className="author-proof">Eight years in China <i>·</i> Clients in Nigeria, the UK and the US <i>·</i> Founder, FAYFORT International Trading</p>
            <p>I run FAYFORT International Trading — a trading, logistics and consultancy company based in China. I have been here eight years. I speak the language, I know how the markets work, and more usefully, I know which of them are worth your time.</p>
            <p>Most people buying from China are not buying from the factory. They are buying from someone who bought from someone who bought from the factory, and every one of those people took a margin. My work is going directly to the source — finding the factory, walking the market, checking the goods, packing them properly and getting them home.</p>
            <p>I wrote this because I kept answering the same questions. Where do I buy hair? Why is this so expensive? Which market has men’s clothing? I went to Guangzhou for a week and came home with nothing.</p>
            <p>The addresses in this book are the answer to most of them. They are not secret and they are not magic — they are just hard to find, because the people who know them do not write them down.</p>
            <p className="author-sign">So I wrote them down.</p>

              <p>Guangzhou is a trading city inside a province that manufactures for most of the world. Around the fair complex sit close to a thousand specialised wholesale markets, open every day of the year, with minimums measured in dozens rather than tens of thousands. Behind those, in towns an hour or two away, are the factories that supply them.</p>
              <p>None of it closes when the fair closes. None of it requires a badge.</p>
              <p>The problem was never that the markets are secret. It is that the people who know them do not write them down, and the people who write market guides have usually never stood in the buildings.</p>
